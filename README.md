# duel-of-wits

Helps running the subsystem Duel of Wits from the tabletop RPG Burning Wheel.  See https://img.fireden.net/tg/image/1462/04/1462044110159.pdf for the rules of Duel of Wits.

It's effectively a complicated game of rock paper scissors, with standard or versus tests determining how much "Body of Argument" (hit points) their opponent loses, and the first to zero loses the argument and must do what the other wants.  They are allowed to demand compromises depending on how much they took away from their opponent's argument.

To use this applet:

First describe your statement of purpose.  This is what will happen if you win.
Roll the body of argument for each player, using the number and shade of dice equal to their primary skill.

For each volley, enter each player's action choice and click the "X volley" button to roll to determine the victor in that volley.
